## Arithmetic Operators

1. Write a JavaScript code snippet that uses arithmetic operators to calculate the area of a circle given its radius. Assume the radius is 7. Display the result using `console.log`.

2. Given the variables `a = 10`, `b = 20`, and `c = 5`, write a JavaScript code to find the value of `(a * b) / c + (b - a)`. Use `console.log` to display the result.

## Assignment Operators

3. Given the variables `x = 5` and `y = 10`, use assignment operators to increment `x` by 2 and multiply `y` by `x`. Display the new values of `x` and `y` using `console.log`.

4. Write a JavaScript code snippet that uses the compound assignment operators to perform the following operations: 
    - Add 15 to `num`
    - Subtract 5 from `num`
    - Multiply `num` by 3
    - Divide `num` by 2  
  Initialize `num` to 10, and log the result after each operation.

## Comparison Operators

5. Given the variables `score1 = 85` and `score2 = 90`, write a JavaScript code using comparison operators to check if both scores are greater than 80 and display the result using `console.log`.

6. Write a JavaScript code snippet to compare two strings, `"apple"` and `"banana"`, using comparison operators to check if the first string is less than the second string. Display the result using `console.log`.

## Logical Operators

7. Given `age = 25` and `hasDrivingLicense = true`, use logical operators to write a condition that checks if the person is eligible to drive. Print the result using `console.log`.

8. Write a JavaScript code snippet that checks if a number is between 10 and 50 (inclusive) or is a multiple of 5 using logical operators. Display the result using `console.log`.

## Type Conversion

9. Write a JavaScript code snippet that converts a string `"123.45"` to a number and adds 10 to it. Display the result using `console.log`.

10. Write a JavaScript code snippet to convert a boolean value `true` to a string and concatenate it with `" is the value"`. Use `console.log` to display the result.

## `console.log` and `innerHTML`

11. Write a JavaScript code snippet that updates the content of a `<div>` with id `output` to show the result of `15 * 3` using `innerHTML`.

12. Write a JavaScript code snippet that uses `console.log` to display the values of variables `a = 5`, `b = 10`, and the result of their addition.

13. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  
Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday.
Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38

14. Write a JavaScript program to print the current window contents.  


15. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.  
Expected Output :
mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy.


16. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where three sides are 5, 6, 7.
