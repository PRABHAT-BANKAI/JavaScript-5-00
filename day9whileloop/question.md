## **For Loop Questions:**

1. Write a JavaScript program using a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 1 to 50.

2. Write a JavaScript program using a `for` loop that prints the multiplication table for the number 5 (from 1 to 10).

3. Using a `for` loop, create a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer `n`.

4. Write a JavaScript program that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print “Buzz.”

5. Using a `for` loop, create a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

6. Write a `for` loop that prints the cube of all numbers from 1 to 10.

7. Write a `for` loop that prints the sum of squares of all odd numbers from 1 to 20.

8. Write a `for` loop that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 between 1 and 100.

9. Using a `for` loop, write a program that calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to 10.

## **While Loop Questions:**

10. Write a JavaScript program using a `while` loop that prints all numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

11. Write a `while` loop that keeps doubling a number starting from 1 until the number exceeds 1000, and then prints the final value.

12. Write a program that uses a `while` loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

13. Using a `while` loop, create a program that finds and prints the first 5 numbers divisible by both 3 and 7.

## **Do-While Loop Question:**

14. Write a JavaScript program using a do-while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. The loop should run at least once, regardless of the condition.
